# File-O-Matic
A program for automatically downloading, sorting and saving emails to a 
filesystem, organised by sender.

The File-O-Matic was written in response to the frustrations of staff at a 
major British university whose job was to assist disabled students but 
every month had to block out entire days to ‘file’ their emails.

This entailed hours of repetitive left-clicking and folder creation, a very 
boring, error-prone process for people who would much prefer to support 
students rather than doing something that we have forgotten that computers 
were invented to do for us.

## Usage

On first run, the File-O-Matic will create a skeleton .fomrc file. This must 
be filled in with the relevant details (IMAP server is the only one which is 
not self-explanatory and may need to be looked up). Passwords are not stored 
and need to be entered interactively. The program then gets on with its job.
